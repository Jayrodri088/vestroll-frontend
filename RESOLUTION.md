# Vestroll Frontend - Conflict Resolution

## Summary

This document outlines the conflicts that were identified and resolved in the Vestroll frontend application, ensuring the project now runs smoothly on port 3003.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Package Manager Conflicts
The project had multiple package manager lock files which caused conflicts:
- `package-lock.json` (npm)
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` (pnpm)
- `bun.lock` (bun)

This created inconsistency in dependency management and could lead to different behaviors across development environments.

### 2. Turbopack Workspace Root Warning
Next.js Turbopack was showing a warning about incorrectly inferred workspace root, which could affect build performance and consistency.

### 3. Port Conflicts
Multiple instances of the development server were causing port conflicts, requiring the server to use alternative ports.

## Resolutions Applied

### 1. Standardized Package Manager
- Removed conflicting lock files: `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `bun.lock`
- Kept only `package-lock.json` for npm consistency
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future conflicts with other package manager files

### 2. Configured Turbopack Root
- Added proper `turbopack.root` configuration in `next.config.ts`
- Used dynamic path resolution for better portability

### 3. Server Availability
- The development server is now running successfully on port 3003
- Local access: http://localhost:3003
- Network access: http://192.168.1.32:3003

## Current Status

The application is now running without conflicts:
- ✅ No package manager conflicts
- ✅ Proper Turbopack configuration
- ✅ Server running on port 3003

## Running the Application

To start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start on http://localhost:3003 (or the next available port if 3003 is in use).

## Preventing Future Conflicts

1. Stick to npm as the package manager
2. Ensure `.gitignore` includes other package manager lock files
3. Maintain consistent dependency management across all development environments
